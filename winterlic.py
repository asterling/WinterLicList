Toronto's open-data endpoint is the same year-round; the city swaps the active
campaign in place (Winterlicious in Jan/Feb, Summerlicious in Jul/Aug). This
script writes three files so the frontend can stay generic:

  - menus-latest.json                  always the freshest snapshot
  - menus-{Winter,Summer}licious-YYYY.json  per-campaign archive
  - season.json                        metadata (label, season, year)
